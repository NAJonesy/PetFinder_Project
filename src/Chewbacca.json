He can go for walks but he doesn't have to go for walks. Yard or no yard... he'll be fine. Chewy is a fella that likes all ages young and matured. Chewy is an 8ish year old Lhasa Apso is house trained, okay on a leash, rides well in the car, and good with other dogs. Chewbacca has recently discovered hair for men. This guy has a lack of hair nearly everywhere on his body except his head which makes him incredibly adorable. The cool thing is... it is growing back slowly but surely! Chewy is doing well on learning his crate skills but would much rather be near his people and can bark a bit to tell you he misses you. He isn't destructive in or out of the crate so continuing his crate training would be up to you. He is a bundle of joy that is excited to have a family to call his own!\nYou may apply for Chewbacca at www.pawpatroldayton.com. His adoption fee is $175 and he is vaccinated, neutered, microchipped, and heartworm negative. All of our animals are vaccinated, micro-chipped and spayed/neutered before being adopted.\n\n\n"},
